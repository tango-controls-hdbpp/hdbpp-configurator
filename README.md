# Java GUI configurator for TANGO HDB++

 - The TANGO archiving system is a tool allowing TANGO users to store the readings coming from a TANGO based control system into a database.
 - The archived data are essential for the day by day operation of complex scientific facilities for instance.
 - They can be used for long term monitoring of subsystems, statistics, parameters correlation or comparison of operating setups over time.
 - To take advantage of the fast and lightweight event-driven communication provided by TANGO release 8 with the adoption of ZeroMQ,
	    a novel archiving system for the TANGO Controls framework, named HDB++, has been designed and developed,
	    resulting from a collaboration between Elettra and ESRF at the beginning.
 - HDB++ design allows TANGO users to store data with microsecond timestamp resolution into traditional database management systems
	    such as MySQL or into NoSQL databases such as Apache Cassandra.
